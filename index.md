# ***HIV Worldwide 1990-2015 Visualization***

### Background and Motivation 

The Project shows the distribution of HIV and AIDS patients and their changes from the year 1990 to 2015. The project contains different visualization like Choropleth , bar and line graph. There is not specific reason for choosing this dataset and visualizing it. But while researching about dataset I found it very interesting to work on. Thereâ€™s no special research interest for choosing of the dataset, the dataset itself is good and visualizing on it would help in getting trends about HIV and Aids among different set of ages and help us in summarizing the problems by targeting the most affected ages for the disease with the help of visualization. The dataset contains distribution of HIV and Aids contracted humans into sets of ages which can be used to visualize the trends and find out the correct summary from the dataset with the help of the data visualization. For future I was thinking I might use machine learning on the dataset if I get more detailed dataset with the same schema and would love to further work on that.

### Description 

The project contains 4 different Visualizations which shows the following objectives : 
P1:  The distribution of HIV patients or AIDS over the world for different year using Filter.
P2: The distribution of living HIV patients or death due to aids for a specific country for a specific year for different group of ages using Filtering by year and different set of groups.
P3: What are the total aids related deaths, prevalence of HIV infections, new HIV infections and people having HIV infections already in a specific country or over the world for a specific year?
P4: What is distribution of Aids related deaths for the specific groups for a specific year in a country?
P5: Comparison of Different countries in terms of the distribution of different categories.
P6: Spread of the HIV Infection in the country.
