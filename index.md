# ***HIV Worldwide 1990-2015 Visualization***

### Background and Motivation 

The Project shows the distribution of HIV and AIDS patients and their changes from the year 1990 to 2015. The project contains different visualization like Choropleth , bar and line graph. There is not specific reason for choosing this dataset and visualizing it. But while researching about dataset I found it very interesting to work on. Thereâ€™s no special research interest for choosing of the dataset, the dataset itself is good and visualizing on it would help in getting trends about HIV and Aids among different set of ages and help us in summarizing the problems by targeting the most affected ages for the disease with the help of visualization. The dataset contains distribution of HIV and Aids contracted humans into sets of ages which can be used to visualize the trends and find out the correct summary from the dataset with the help of the data visualization. For future I was thinking I might use machine learning on the dataset if I get more detailed dataset with the same schema and would love to further work on that.
